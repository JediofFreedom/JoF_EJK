# Environmental lightning regression

The tests compile `FX_ForceLightningReference` directly from `fx_force.c` and
compare its direction and timing events against a recorded 14-frame fixture.
They verify trace endpoints, cached directions, arc emission, sound calls,
random-call order and timer state at `cg_lightningEnvironmentAngle 360`.

Eight runs cover every combination of optional narrow, wide and arc effects.
They check hand axes, fallback surface placement and filtering, and the absence
of duplicate fallback impacts when a pack arc owns its impact effect.
Float comparisons allow 0.001 units for platform rounding differences.

Environment audio selects six stock spark samples. Sound IDs are grouped into
three variants for fixture comparison; timing and random-call order are checked
directly. Registration checks cover all six stock paths.

`lightning_forward_arc_check` exercises 3,853 cases of the same production helper:
fresh and cached directions, left/right angle boundaries, backwards directions,
player yaw/pitch, narrow/wide lightning, hits/misses and cvar bounds. It checks
that traces and emitted bolts stay within the configured cone, redirects preserve
trace reach, and the sound positions and timers follow the accepted traces.
