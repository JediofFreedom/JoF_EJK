# Force Destruction

A Legends / Jedi Knight-inspired dark-side power: a concentrated, non-homing
energy orb that bursts on contact. It damages and knocks back nearby targets,
including its caster at close range. This is a server-granted extra ability,
like the Repulse wheel integration, not a new purchasable force-power rank.

## Enable and use

Install the updated game module on the server. For the wheel integration and
optional custom media support, install the updated client executable/cgame.
No Destruction-specific asset pack is required or bundled. On this repo's
game server, set:

```text
seta g_forceDestruction 1
```

Living dark-side players receive the ability automatically. Select **Destruction**
in the force wheel and press Use Force, or bind it directly:

```text
bind x force_destruction
```

The wheel places it after Repulse and before Lightning. Missing powers are
skipped without moving Destruction to the end of the wheel.
Dash stays before Speed's position, and Stasis/Repulse after Sense's position,
even when those real powers are not owned.
Holding Use Force does not repeat the cast. No Lightning rank is required.
Turning the server setting off or changing to the light side removes the grant.
Unsupported servers do not get the wheel entry or client-generated command.

## Server settings

| Setting | Default | Effective range |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `g_forceDestruction` | 0 (disabled) | 0 / 1 |
| `g_forceDestructionCost` | 50 Force | 1–100 |
| `g_forceDestructionDamage` | 90 | 1–500 |
| `g_forceDestructionRadius` | 160 units | 16–512 |
| `g_forceDestructionSpeed` | 900 units/second | 100–3000 |
| `g_forceDestructionCooldown` | 4000 ms | 500–30000 |

Out-of-range tuning values are clamped when casting. The orb expires after 15
seconds, does not home, and costs no ammunition. Casting has a 250 ms hand charge before launch and
650 ms of total recovery
and delays Force regeneration for one second. Successful casts end spawn protection.
Damage/radius/speed are captured when charging begins, so tuning changes cannot
alter an in-flight blast.

Direct hits use the full configured damage. Splash falls off with distance from
the target's bounds and requires line of sight; the direct target is not hit twice.
Armor, Protect, normal damage attribution and friendly-fire scaling still apply.
Absorb counters the blast as level-three Force energy: levels 1/2 reduce it, and
level 3 cancels it while converting some spent energy to Force. Ysalamiri blocks
its damage. Teammates with friendly fire disabled, protected duel bystanders,
and players in other dimensions receive neither damage nor knockback.

Spectators, dead players, racers and non-Jedi cannot cast. The usual offensive
Force restrictions apply, including Ysalamiri, vehicles, restricted duels,
broken arms, saber restrictions, grabs and saber locks. Casting is blocked while
paused, during intermission, or before a Siege round starts. Disabling all normal
Force powers also prevents the grant; bit 21 of `g_forcePowerDisable` (or its FFA
variant) can disable only Destruction.

## Compatibility and checks

The grant occupies bit 21 of `forcePowersKnown`; wheel slot 21 is display-only.
The client also requires the server's `g_forceDestruction` advertisement, so an
unrelated mod using the same spare bit does not accidentally expose this ability.
`NUM_FORCE_POWERS`, networked force arrays, force configuration strings, and real
`forcesel` values stay unchanged. The dedicated `force_destruction` command is
validated by the server on every request. The missile uses the existing concussion
entity type with a reserved `generic1` marker (213). Its networked FX overrides
reference only stock `concussion/shot` and `concussion/explosion` assets, including
on saber-only maps. Vanilla and older clients therefore see a normal concussion
projectile and explosion without downloading custom assets. Damage and knockback
remain server-authoritative; vanilla clients do not gain the new wheel entry.

On JoF JA+ V123, the client keeps a server-granted Destruction entry and command
available during jetpack flight, floating and noclip. Dead players, spectators
and followers remain excluded. The server still decides whether a cast is allowed;
keeping the noclip entry visible does not authorize a noclip cast.

The hand charge uses `PW_DISINT_4` and bit 21 of `forcePowersActive`
(`DESTRUCTION_HAND_FLAG`, distinct from the grant in `forcePowersKnown`). It takes
precedence over the remote caster's vanilla Grip compatibility bit. The hand plays
the Drain hand effect `effects/force/drain_hand.efx`, regardless of
`cp_pluginDisable` and `cg_drainFX` (nothing is drawn if the file is missing).
It plays at the left hand with the Drain axis (torso pitch/yaw); Super
Destruction (melee or the two-handed lightning pose) plays it on both hands
every frame. The effect is attached to the hand bolt (relative, like single
player's Drain) because `drain_hand.efx` spawns most particles 0-400 ms late; it
falls back to a plain play at the hand when the bolt cannot be used. The hand effect is hidden in the caster's first-person view and when
mind-tricked. Emission stops as soon as the server clears the flags; existing particles finish
their lifetime. This repo's server sends the hand flags for a 250 ms charge, clears them when
launching the orb, and keeps its 650 ms total recovery. Interrupted charges
clear the flags without launching; Force cost and cooldown are spent at charge
start. Death, losing the grant, restricted states, pause/intermission, dimension
changes, and blocked launch positions cancel the cast. V123 controls its own
charge flags and cast timing.

Updated clients recognize the missile marker and use the original local media paths:

- Trail: `effects/forcedestruction/destruction.efx`.
- Impact: `effects/forcedestruction/destruction_explode_enhanced2.efx`, falling
  back to `effects/forcedestruction/destruction_explode.efx`.
- Wheel icon: `gfx/forcedestruction/force_destruction.tga`.
- Cast sound: `sound/forcedestruction/destruction.mp3`.
- Impact sounds: `sound/forcedestruction/forcedestruct01.wav` and
  `forcedestruct02.wav`, alternating by missile entity number.

The custom travelling orb emits three layers per rendered frame, controlled by
`DESTRUCTION_EFX_LAYERS`. Stock concussion trails and all impacts play once.
Custom impact EFX must not contain `Sound` blocks: cgame selects impact audio
independently to avoid doubled sounds. Custom WAV samples must be mono.
Super Destruction (cast with melee) is marked by the server with `iModelScale` 115
on the orb (and a 1.15x hitbox). When both `destruction.efx` and the optional
`effects/forcedestruction/destruction_super.efx` (the same orb with sizes x1.15)
are installed, the Super orb plays `destruction_super.efx` with the same layering;
otherwise it uses the normal orb.

Custom media are not bundled in this repo or `jofclient-assets.pk3`. Install the
custom EFX and all their texture/shader dependencies locally. Missing trail/impact
effects retain stock concussion visuals and their embedded audio. A missing icon
uses Lightning's icon; a missing cast sound uses Force Push. Missing impact
samples use the other sample, or stock mine-impact audio if neither is available.
The server advertises stock FX and a tagged stock Force Push sound event so
vanilla clients require no custom media. Normal weapon visuals and sounds are
unchanged.

This adapts the reference rendering to this branch's protocol: it retains
Destruction bit 21 and the tagged concussion missile instead of the reference's
active bit and missile table. The reference's file/model/class override system
and fractional client clock are not ported. Gameplay/damage and server charge
timing remain independent of the installed media.

Run the focused regression checks (add `-A x64` or `-A Win32` when using Visual Studio):

```text
cmake -S tests/force-destruction -B build/force-destruction-check
cmake --build build/force-destruction-check --config Release
ctest --test-dir build/force-destruction-check -C Release --output-on-failure
```

These compile the real ability, Force restriction/Absorb helpers, wheel builder,
input routing and FX selection/playback code against mocked engine services;
they are not an in-game test. Media checks cover all 256 combinations of
missing/present trail, Super trail, both impact effects, icon and three
sound files, unchanged ordinary weapon handling, and custom impact audio.
The asset check ensures custom media are not bundled.
Hand checks cover drain_hand.efx under every Drain setting and when missing, the
Drain axis, left hand only for normal casts and both hands every frame for Melee,
matrix reuse, first-person/mind-trick hiding, stopping emission when flags clear,
and unchanged Push/Grip routing.
Wheel checks include all 128 combinations of extra grants and their anchor powers,
plus flying/noclip eligibility and protected spectator/dead input states.

In-game checks before release:

- Enable/disable while connected; change sides, die/respawn, spectate and reconnect.
- Cycle both directions, let the wheel fade, hold/release Use Force, and use the direct bind.
- Try insufficient Force, rapid command spam, no-Force areas, vehicles and melee grabs.
- Test a direct hit, splash falloff, cover, nearby self-damage, NPCs and breakable props.
- Test Absorb 1/2/3, Protect, friendly fire off/on, separate duels and dimensions.
- Check the effect, sound and icon at different frame rates, then join an unmodified server.
- Join with a vanilla client and no custom assets; verify projectile and explosion
  visibility on a saber-only map. On an updated client, test a missing asset pack,
  each missing EFX, icon and sound file separately; then restore the pack
  and confirm custom visuals. Check normal concussion shots alongside Destruction.
